Welcome to Zend Framework 1.5.2! This is a maintenance release of the 
Zend Framework 1.5 series. This release maintains backwards compatibility with
the Zend Framework 1.0 series and has been rigorously tested with many
applications written for 1.0.
HOWEVER, PLEASE READ ALL SPECIAL NOTICES FOR UPGRADING IN THIS README *BEFORE*
UPGRADING APPLICATIONS WRITTEN ON ZF 1.0 TO ZF 1.5.

RELEASE INFORMATION
---------------

Zend Framework 1.5.2 (revision 9458).
Released on 2008-05-15.

SPECIAL NOTICES FOR UPGRADING TO ZF 1.5
---------------------------------------

* If you are upgrading from a 1.0 ZF release to a 1.5 ZF release and you are using
  Zend_Search_Lucene, you should be aware that Zend_Search_Lucene now works
  exclusively with Apache Lucene 2.1 index file format. Conversion from the
  previous format (1.9) is performed automatically during the first index update
  after the ZF 1.5 release is installed. *THIS CONVERSION CANNOT BE UNDONE*.
  Please backup your Lucene index if you plan to rollback to 1.0 versions of Zend
  Framework and wish to continue using this index.

* Some developers have relied on undocumented and unintended behavior of
  Zend_Controller in 1.0 ZF releases that allowed resolution from camelCased URLs to
  controller actions. This unintended behavior, however, causes indeterminate results
  later in the request dispatching process. For this reason, we have chosen to enforce
  our documented recommendations. URLs now require word separator characters when
  resolving to camelCased action methods. For more information, please see:

    http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.controller.migration.html
