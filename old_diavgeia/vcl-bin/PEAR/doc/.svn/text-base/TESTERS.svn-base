HOW TO TEST PEAR DB
===================

$Id: TESTERS,v 1.20 2005/02/16 06:33:12 danielc Exp $


INTRODUCTION
============

These are instructions for testing PEAR DB on a Windows machine using a
Cygwin Bash shell.  Adjust the paths and commands to match your system.
This configuration is used because these precise steps are known to work.

NOTE:  You must log on as a user which has permissions to modify the
contents of your PHP executable's directory.  This is necessary for both
configuring AND running the test system.


INSTALLATION
============

Obtain PHP's Test Framework
---------------------------
If you don't have PHP's test framework, you need to obtain it.  These
steps include changing the working directory, downloading run-tests.php
via CVS and copying the file into place.  Change the revision flag in the
CVS command as appropriate for your present version of PHP.

 cd c:/progra~1/php
 cvs -d :pserver:cvsread@cvs.php.net:/repository login   # password is phpfi
 cvs -d :pserver:cvsread@cvs.php.net:/repository co -r PHP_4_3 \
     -d test php-src/run-tests.php
 cp test/run-tests.php .
 rm -rf test


Obtain DB and its Test Framework
--------------------------------
* IF PEAR DB IS ALREADY INSTALLED:

  If you have PEAR DB installed already, good.  The test suite
  is in place.  Open up a command/shell prompt and move into
  the test directory.

   cd <path to pear insall>/tests/DB/tests

* VIA A NEW INSTALLATION USING THE PEAR INSTALLER:

  Installing PEAR has gotten fairly easy.  Follow the instructions
  from the manual:  http://pear.php.net/manual/en/installation.php
  Once PEAR and DB are installed, move to the test directory.

   cd pear/tests/DB/tests

* VIA CVS:

  Create a location to store the test installation of DB and its
  test scripts.

   mkdir d:/peartest
   cd d:/peartest
   cvs -d :pserver:cvsread@cvs.php.net:/repository co -P pear/DB

  We assume you already have the PEAR base package installed.  If
  you don't, you will need to do so, but the instructions for
  doing that are beyond the scope of this document.  See
  http://pear.php.net/manual/en/installation.php for more info.

  Move to the test directory.

   cd pear/DB/tests


Copy the Starter Shell Script and Edit the Paths
------------------------------------------------
To make starting up each test run easier, we have included two shell
scripts.  The original files are named "run.cvs".  They need to be
renamed to "run" so CVS won't bother you with tracking them.  Then,
the paths and file names in them need to be set to those used by
your system.

 cp run.cvs run
 chmod 755 run
 vi run

 cd driver
 cp run.cvs run
 chmod 755 run
 vi run


Copy the Setup File and Edit the DSN's
--------------------------------------
The test suite contains a file that stores the DSN's needed to
connect to your database.  The original file is "setup.inc.cvs"
and it needs to be renamed "setup.inc" so CVS won't track it.
Then you'll need to edit the DSN's in it.

 cp setup.inc.cvs setup.inc
 vi setup.inc


RUN THE TESTS
=============

To run all tests:  ./run
To run one test:   ./run <test file name>
Example:           ./run db_parsedsn.phpt


Test Types and Locations
------------------------
tests             Common PEAR DB tests
tests/driver      Common tests for all the drivers


Results and What To Do With Them
--------------------------------
Each test that fails generates a .php (which you can execute), a .exp
(the expected output), a .out (the test output) and a .diff (a diff -u
from the .exp and .out files).

If you run the tests, please report or fill the TEST CONFORMANCE table
in the STATUS document.  Before any commit to CVS be sure to run the
tests and nothing got broken with the change.

If you get the message "SKIP", means that the test it's not executed.
Look at the DB/tests/driver/skipif.inc to see what's the problem
(probably a connection problem).
