Libchart ChangeLog

==========
  CHANGES:
    * Added Line Charts

  BUGFIXES:
    * Removed undefined IMG_ARC_FILL constant
    * Added missing default parameter in HorizontalChart::render()
    * Fixed decimal values in Bar Charts
    * Typo in default logo
    * Crashed when no point was defined
    * Crashed when all values were set to 0
