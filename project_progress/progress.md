### GSoC 2017:  Project Progress Report

**Week 4 (24 June - 30 June)**

- Meetup for first evaluations, discussion about project progress and second month-project planning.
- We decided to give priority to the blockchain implementation during the second month coding period.
- I will use [bcoin](http://bcoin.io/) as a node-js bitcoin library. This week i have:
  1. Familiarize myself even more with bitcoin concepts and bcoin library.
  2. Implemented Diavgeia's wallet and added some helpful functions regarding the configuration of application. You can find the code [here](https://github.com/eellak/gsoc17-diavgeia/tree/master/bitcoin)

**Week 3 (17 June - 23 June)**

- Complete the rdf schema with the remaining decisions and create the relevant [samples](https://github.com/eellak/gsoc17-diavgeia/tree/master/rdf/samples).
- I wrote an extensive rdf documentation that can be found [here](https://github.com/eellak/gsoc17-diavgeia/blob/master/rdf/README.md). The documentation explains in depth the following topics:
  1. Current Diavgeia Issues
  2. The RDF Schema
  3. Decision Types and Samples
  4. URIs - ELI
  5. General Schema Classes
  6. Common Data Properties
  7. Decision specific Object and Data Properties
  8. The impact of RDF usage on Diavgeia infrastructure (Conclusions)

**Week 2 (9 June - 16 June)**

- Extend the rdf schema, in order to support 24 out of 33 decision types.
- Create [samples](https://github.com/eellak/gsoc17-diavgeia/tree/master/rdf/samples) for each currently supported decision type. Every directory of the given link corresponds to a decision type. These directories may have 3 or 4 files inside. More specifically:
  1. There is a `.pdf` file, which is found in the current production website of Diavgeia and it can be downloaded from https://diavgeia.gov.gr/{IUN}
  2. A `metadata.json` file, which has the metadata that government institutions may fill during the procedure. Metadata is downloaded from https://diavgeia.gov.gr/luminapi/api/decisions/{IUN}
  3. Î‘ `version_history.json` file, which corresponds to the history of a specific decision. This file is included only in the examples that alternate a decision (e.g. this [DonationGrant](https://github.com/eellak/gsoc17-diavgeia/blob/master/rdf/samples/DonationGrant/version_history.json))
  4. A `.n3` file, which is the decision expressed according to the rdf schema.
- By exploring the `.n3` files, it is fairly simple to understand the rdf schema. There are various examples, in which you can see the way:
  1. An economic transaction among government institution and individuals.
  2. Alternations of decision.
  3. Government institutions express their personal info (e.g. address, telephone, etc).
  4. Linking of a decision with another decision or with the [greek legislation ontology](http://legislation.di.uoa.gr/).
  5. A lot of decision specific details expressed in rdf (a more thorough documentation for each decision will be available in the following two weeks).

**Week 1 (1 June - 8 June)**

- Finalize project description.
- Make myself familiar with the different types of decisions and greek legislation.
- Implement a first version of the decisions rdf schema. More specifically:
1. The rdf schema includes all possible types of decisions that can be uploaded by the government institutions.
2. Decisions extend the [ELI](http://www.eli.fr/en/), as a way to unify them with other EU and Member States' legal systems. Thus, decisions have the following format:
`http://diavgeia.gov.gr/eli/decision/{IUN}/{version}`.
**IUN** :  Internet Uploading Number (greeks know it as ADA)
**version** : When a decision is altered (that is a *RepeatToCorrect* or a *MetadataCorrection*), a new version is generated but the IUN is not changed.
3. The problem of "taking into consideration the law X - we decide" is solved by linking decisions with the [greek legislation ontology](http://legislation.di.uoa.gr/) or by linking to other decisions of our ontology.
4. I created a sample [.n3 file](https://github.com/eellak/gsoc17-diavgeia/blob/master/rdf/samples/6%CE%96%CE%9E74653%CE%A0%CE%A9-7%CE%9AM.n3) which is equivalent to the decision [pdf file](https://github.com/eellak/gsoc17-diavgeia/blob/master/rdf/samples/6%CE%96%CE%9E74653%CE%A0%CE%A9-7%CE%9A%CE%9C.pdf). As expected, the size of the .n3 file has size 5.18KB, whereas the .pdf file's size is 419KB (about 81 times smaller in size). This seems to be really promising and provides a solution to the hard disk space needs of Diavgeia. Moreover, .n3 file includes metadata which is not included in the original pdf file.
5. I have enriched the rdf-schema with specialized metadata of BudgetApproval Decision and i aim to cover more decision types in the next weeks.
