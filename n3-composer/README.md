# N3-Composer

> App based on Nuxt & Vue that greek government institutions can use, in order to compose their decisions in a HTML form. The submission of the form results to the creation of a .n3 decision

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [Nuxt.js docs](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js).

## Backpack

We use [backpack](https://github.com/palmerhq/backpack) to watch and build the application, so you can use the latest ES6 features (module syntax, async/await, etc.).
